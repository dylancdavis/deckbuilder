            - Code quality and adherence to repository conventions (check CLAUDE.md)

            - Performance implications
            - Security considerations
            - Test coverage and missing tests
            - TypeScript/Vue 3 best practices
            - Game logic correctness (this is a deckbuilding game)
            
            Be constructive and specific in your feedback. If the code looks good, approve it. If there are issues, request changes with clear explanations.
